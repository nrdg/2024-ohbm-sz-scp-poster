  abstract = "Statistical models employed to test for group differences in
              quantized diffusion-weighted MRI white matter tracts often fail
              to account for the large number of data points per tract in
              addition to the distribution, type, and interdependence of the
              data. To address these issues, we propose the use of Generalized
              Additive Models (GAMs) and supply code and examples to aid in
              their implementation. Specifically, using diffusion data from 73
              periadolescent clinically anxious and no-psychiatric-diagnosis
              control participants, we tested for group tract differences and
              show that a GAM allows for the identification of differences
              within a tract while accounting for the nature of the data as
              well as covariates and group factors. Further, we then used these
              tract differences to investigate their association with
              performance on a memory test. When comparing our high versus low
              anxiety groups, we observed a positive association between the
              left uncinate fasciculus and memory overgeneralization for
              negatively valenced stimuli. This same association was not
              evident in the right uncinate or anterior forceps. These findings
              illustrate that GAMs are well-suited for modeling diffusion data
              while accounting for various aspects of the data, and suggest
              that the adoption of GAMs will be a powerful investigatory tool
              for diffusion-weighted analyses.",

  abstract = "In addition to motor functions, it has become clear that in
              humans the cerebellum plays a significant role in cognition too,
              through connections with associative areas in the cerebral
              cortex. Classical anatomy indicates that neo-cerebellar regions
              are connected with the contralateral cerebral cortex through the
              dentate nucleus, superior cerebellar peduncle, red nucleus and
              ventrolateral anterior nucleus of the thalamus. The anatomical
              existence of these connections has been demonstrated using virus
              retrograde transport techniques in monkeys and rats ex vivo. In
              this study, using advanced diffusion MRI tractography we show
              that it is possible to calculate streamlines to reconstruct the
              pathway connecting the cerebellar cortex with contralateral
              cerebral cortex in humans in vivo. Corresponding areas of the
              cerebellar and cerebral cortex encompassed similar proportion
              (about 80\%) of the tract, suggesting that the majority of
              streamlines passing through the superior cerebellar peduncle
              connect the cerebellar hemispheres through the ventrolateral
              thalamus with contralateral associative areas. This result
              demonstrates that this kind of tractography is a useful tool to
              map connections between the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex
              and moreover could be used to support specific theories about the
              abnormal communication along these pathways in cognitive
              dysfunctions in pathologies ranging from dyslexia to autism.",

  abstract  = "Abstract Fluent speech production is a complex task that spans
               multiple processes, from conceptual framing and lexical access,
               through phonological encoding, to articulatory control. For the
               most part, imaging studies portraying the neural correlates of
               speech fluency tend to examine clinical populations sustaining
               speech impairments, and focus on either lexical access or
               articulatory control, but not both. Here, we evaluated the
               contribution of the cerebellar peduncles to speech fluency by
               measuring the different components of the process, in a sample
               of forty-five neurotypical adults. Participants underwent an
               unstructured interview to assess their natural speaking rate and
               articulation rate, and completed timed semantic and phonemic
               fluency tasks to assess their verbal fluency. Diffusion MRI with
               probabilistic tractography was used to segment the bilateral
               cerebellar peduncles (CPs) and frontal aslant tract (FAT),
               previously associated with speech production in clinical
               populations. Our results demonstrate distinct patterns of white
               matter associations with different fluency components.
               Specifically, verbal fluency is associated with the right
               superior CP, whereas speaking rate is associated with the right
               middle CP and bilateral FAT. No association is found with
               articulation rate in these pathways, in contrast to previous
               findings in persons who stutter. Our findings support the
               contribution of the cerebellum to aspects of speech production
               that go beyond articulatory control, such as lexical access,
               pragmatic or syntactic generation. Further, we demonstrate that
               distinct cerebellar pathways dissociate different components of
               speech fluency in neurotypical speakers.",
