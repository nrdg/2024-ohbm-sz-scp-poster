  abstract = "Statistical models employed to test for group differences in
              quantized diffusion-weighted MRI white matter tracts often fail
              to account for the large number of data points per tract in
              addition to the distribution, type, and interdependence of the
              data. To address these issues, we propose the use of Generalized
              Additive Models (GAMs) and supply code and examples to aid in
              their implementation. Specifically, using diffusion data from 73
              periadolescent clinically anxious and no-psychiatric-diagnosis
              control participants, we tested for group tract differences and
              show that a GAM allows for the identification of differences
              within a tract while accounting for the nature of the data as
              well as covariates and group factors. Further, we then used these
              tract differences to investigate their association with
              performance on a memory test. When comparing our high versus low
              anxiety groups, we observed a positive association between the
              left uncinate fasciculus and memory overgeneralization for
              negatively valenced stimuli. This same association was not
              evident in the right uncinate or anterior forceps. These findings
              illustrate that GAMs are well-suited for modeling diffusion data
              while accounting for various aspects of the data, and suggest
              that the adoption of GAMs will be a powerful investigatory tool
              for diffusion-weighted analyses.",

              challenge due to the immense complexity of global brain networks.
              Here we introduce a noninvasive method that uses diffusion MRI to
              characterize whole-brain white matter architecture as a single
              local connectome fingerprint that allows for a direct comparison
              between structural connectomes. In four independently acquired
              data sets with repeated scans (total N = 213), we show that the
              local connectome fingerprint is highly specific to an individual,
              allowing for an accurate self-versus-others classification that
              achieved 100\% accuracy across 17,398 identification tests. The
              estimated classification error was approximately one thousand
              times smaller than fingerprints derived from diffusivity-based
              measures or region-to-region connectivity patterns for repeat
              scans acquired within 3 months. The local connectome fingerprint
              also revealed neuroplasticity within an individual reflected as a
              decreasing trend in self-similarity across time, whereas this
              change was not observed in the diffusivity measures. Moreover,
              the local connectome fingerprint can be used as a phenotypic
              marker, revealing 12.51\% similarity between monozygotic twins,
              5.14\% between dizygotic twins, and 4.51\% between none-twin
              siblings, relative to differences between unrelated subjects.
              This novel approach opens a new door for probing the influence of
              pathological, genetic, social, or environmental factors on the
              unique configuration of the human connectome.",
