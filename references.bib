  abstract = "Statistical models employed to test for group differences in
              quantized diffusion-weighted MRI white matter tracts often fail
              to account for the large number of data points per tract in
              addition to the distribution, type, and interdependence of the
              data. To address these issues, we propose the use of Generalized
              Additive Models (GAMs) and supply code and examples to aid in
              their implementation. Specifically, using diffusion data from 73
              periadolescent clinically anxious and no-psychiatric-diagnosis
              control participants, we tested for group tract differences and
              show that a GAM allows for the identification of differences
              within a tract while accounting for the nature of the data as
              well as covariates and group factors. Further, we then used these
              tract differences to investigate their association with
              performance on a memory test. When comparing our high versus low
              anxiety groups, we observed a positive association between the
              left uncinate fasciculus and memory overgeneralization for
              negatively valenced stimuli. This same association was not
              evident in the right uncinate or anterior forceps. These findings
              illustrate that GAMs are well-suited for modeling diffusion data
              while accounting for various aspects of the data, and suggest
              that the adoption of GAMs will be a powerful investigatory tool
              for diffusion-weighted analyses.",

              single brain region have been replaced by models that postulate a

              empirical data derived from both magnetic resonance and positron
              emission tomography, we have developed a model that implicates
              connectivity among nodes located in prefrontal regions, the
              thalamic nuclei, and the cerebellum. A disruption in this
              circuitry produces ``cognitive dysmetria,'' difficulty in
              prioritizing, processing, coordinating, and responding to
              information. This ``poor mental coordination'' is a fundamental
              cognitive deficit in schizophrenia and can account for its broad
              diversity of symptoms.",
