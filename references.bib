  abstract = "Statistical models employed to test for group differences in
              quantized diffusion-weighted MRI white matter tracts often fail
              to account for the large number of data points per tract in
              addition to the distribution, type, and interdependence of the
              data. To address these issues, we propose the use of Generalized
              Additive Models (GAMs) and supply code and examples to aid in
              their implementation. Specifically, using diffusion data from 73
              periadolescent clinically anxious and no-psychiatric-diagnosis
              control participants, we tested for group tract differences and
              show that a GAM allows for the identification of differences
              within a tract while accounting for the nature of the data as
              well as covariates and group factors. Further, we then used these
              tract differences to investigate their association with
              performance on a memory test. When comparing our high versus low
              anxiety groups, we observed a positive association between the
              left uncinate fasciculus and memory overgeneralization for
              negatively valenced stimuli. This same association was not
              evident in the right uncinate or anterior forceps. These findings
              illustrate that GAMs are well-suited for modeling diffusion data
              while accounting for various aspects of the data, and suggest
              that the adoption of GAMs will be a powerful investigatory tool
              for diffusion-weighted analyses.",

              humans the cerebellum plays a significant role in cognition too,
              through connections with associative areas in the cerebral
              cortex. Classical anatomy indicates that neo-cerebellar regions
              are connected with the contralateral cerebral cortex through the
              dentate nucleus, superior cerebellar peduncle, red nucleus and
              ventrolateral anterior nucleus of the thalamus. The anatomical
              existence of these connections has been demonstrated using virus

              this study, using advanced diffusion MRI tractography we show
              that it is possible to calculate streamlines to reconstruct the
              pathway connecting the cerebellar cortex with contralateral
              cerebral cortex in humans in vivo. Corresponding areas of the
              cerebellar and cerebral cortex encompassed similar proportion

              connect the cerebellar hemispheres through the ventrolateral
              thalamus with contralateral associative areas. This result
              demonstrates that this kind of tractography is a useful tool to
              map connections between the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex

  abstract  = "Abstract Fluent speech production is a complex task that spans
               multiple processes, from conceptual framing and lexical access,
               through phonological encoding, to articulatory control. For the
               most part, imaging studies portraying the neural correlates of
               speech fluency tend to examine clinical populations sustaining
               speech impairments, and focus on either lexical access or
               articulatory control, but not both. Here, we evaluated the
               contribution of the cerebellar peduncles to speech fluency by
               measuring the different components of the process, in a sample
               of forty-five neurotypical adults. Participants underwent an
               unstructured interview to assess their natural speaking rate and
               articulation rate, and completed timed semantic and phonemic
               fluency tasks to assess their verbal fluency. Diffusion MRI with
               probabilistic tractography was used to segment the bilateral
               cerebellar peduncles (CPs) and frontal aslant tract (FAT),
               previously associated with speech production in clinical
               populations. Our results demonstrate distinct patterns of white
               matter associations with different fluency components.
               Specifically, verbal fluency is associated with the right
               superior CP, whereas speaking rate is associated with the right
               middle CP and bilateral FAT. No association is found with
               articulation rate in these pathways, in contrast to previous
               findings in persons who stutter. Our findings support the
               contribution of the cerebellum to aspects of speech production
               that go beyond articulatory control, such as lexical access,
               pragmatic or syntactic generation. Further, we demonstrate that
               distinct cerebellar pathways dissociate different components of
               speech fluency in neurotypical speakers.",

               of psychosis and distinguish patients from healthy controls,

               from the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study consortium,
               we show that individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis

  abstract = "Tractography based on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data is a
              method for identifying the major white matter fascicles (tracts)
              in the living human brain. The health of these tracts is an
              important factor underlying many cognitive and neurological
              disorders. In vivo, tissue properties may vary systematically
              along each tract for several reasons: different populations of
              axons enter and exit the tract, and disease can strike at local
              positions within the tract. Hence quantifying and understanding
              diffusion measures along each fiber tract (Tract Profile) may
              reveal new insights into white matter development, function, and
              disease that are not obvious from mean measures of that tract. We
              demonstrate several novel findings related to Tract Profiles in
              the brains of typically developing children and children at risk
              for white matter injury secondary to preterm birth. First,
              fractional anisotropy (FA) values vary substantially within a
              tract but the Tract FA Profile is consistent across subjects.
              Thus, Tract Profiles contain far more information than mean
              diffusion measures. Second, developmental changes in FA occur at
              specific positions within the Tract Profile, rather than along
              the entire tract. Third, Tract Profiles can be used to compare
              white matter properties of individual patients to standardized
              Tract Profiles of a healthy population to elucidate unique
              features of that patient's clinical condition. Fourth, Tract
              Profiles can be used to evaluate the association between white
              matter properties and behavioral outcomes. Specifically, in the
              preterm group reading ability is positively correlated with FA
              measured at specific locations on the left arcuate and left
              superior longitudinal fasciculus and the magnitude of the
              correlation varies significantly along the Tract Profiles. We
              introduce open source software for automated fiber-tract
              quantification (AFQ) that measures Tract Profiles of MRI
              parameters for 18 white matter tracts. With further validation,
              AFQ Tract Profiles have potential for informing clinical
