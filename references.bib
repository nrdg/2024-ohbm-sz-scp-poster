  abstract = "Statistical models employed to test for group differences in
              quantized diffusion-weighted MRI white matter tracts often fail
              to account for the large number of data points per tract in
              addition to the distribution, type, and interdependence of the
              data. To address these issues, we propose the use of Generalized
              Additive Models (GAMs) and supply code and examples to aid in
              their implementation. Specifically, using diffusion data from 73
              periadolescent clinically anxious and no-psychiatric-diagnosis
              control participants, we tested for group tract differences and
              show that a GAM allows for the identification of differences
              within a tract while accounting for the nature of the data as
              well as covariates and group factors. Further, we then used these
              tract differences to investigate their association with
              performance on a memory test. When comparing our high versus low
              anxiety groups, we observed a positive association between the
              left uncinate fasciculus and memory overgeneralization for
              negatively valenced stimuli. This same association was not
              evident in the right uncinate or anterior forceps. These findings
              illustrate that GAMs are well-suited for modeling diffusion data
              while accounting for various aspects of the data, and suggest
              that the adoption of GAMs will be a powerful investigatory tool
              for diffusion-weighted analyses.",

              empirical data derived from both magnetic resonance and positron

              connectivity among nodes located in prefrontal regions, the

              circuitry produces ``cognitive dysmetria,'' difficulty in
              prioritizing, processing, coordinating, and responding to
              information. This ``poor mental coordination'' is a fundamental
              cognitive deficit in schizophrenia and can account for its broad

  abstract = "In addition to motor functions, it has become clear that in
              humans the cerebellum plays a significant role in cognition too,
              through connections with associative areas in the cerebral
              cortex. Classical anatomy indicates that neo-cerebellar regions
              are connected with the contralateral cerebral cortex through the
              dentate nucleus, superior cerebellar peduncle, red nucleus and
              ventrolateral anterior nucleus of the thalamus. The anatomical
              existence of these connections has been demonstrated using virus
              retrograde transport techniques in monkeys and rats ex vivo. In
              this study, using advanced diffusion MRI tractography we show
              that it is possible to calculate streamlines to reconstruct the
              pathway connecting the cerebellar cortex with contralateral
              cerebral cortex in humans in vivo. Corresponding areas of the
              cerebellar and cerebral cortex encompassed similar proportion
              (about 80\%) of the tract, suggesting that the majority of
              streamlines passing through the superior cerebellar peduncle
              connect the cerebellar hemispheres through the ventrolateral
              thalamus with contralateral associative areas. This result
              demonstrates that this kind of tractography is a useful tool to
              map connections between the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex
              and moreover could be used to support specific theories about the
              abnormal communication along these pathways in cognitive
              dysfunctions in pathologies ranging from dyslexia to autism.",
